function [ phi_p, phi_t ] = mod_ctrb_disc(A, i, thresh)
% adapted from Jeni's code
% Calculate persistent and transient modal controllability of node i. 
% Intuitively, nodes with high persistent controllability will result in
% large perturbations to slow modes of the system when stimulated, and
% nodes with high transient controllability will result in large
% perturbations to fast modes of the system when stimulated
% Inputs:  
% A         The NxN structural (NOT FUNCTIONAL) network adjacency matrix
% i         This index of the node you wish to calculate the
%           controllability of
% thresh    The thresh hold for calculating persistent and transient modal
%           controllability. For example, if thresh is .1, this will
%           use the 10% slowest modes for persistent controllability, and
%           the 10% fastest modes for transient controllability.

% Outputs:
% phi_p     Persistent controllability of the node (should be between 0 and
%           1)
% phi_t     Transient controllability (should be between 0 and 1)
